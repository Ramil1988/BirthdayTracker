# BirthdayTracker

The BirthdayTracker App will help you not to forget about friends birthdays. This is very simple App, which consist of two screens for adding and displaying the list of friends birthdays. I used simple tableView for this list.

We may store data in the list and then recieve the notifications about the coming birthday. Also, in some cases we may need to delete data by swiping to the left from the current list as well as from device's memory.

For storing data I used Apple's Framework CoreData and for notifications - UserNotifications.
